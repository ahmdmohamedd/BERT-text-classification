## Features
- BERT-based model for text classification.
- Utilizes the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.
- Supports training on GPU for faster performance.
- Customizable for different datasets.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/BERT-text-classification.git
   cd BERT-text-classification
   ```

2. Create and activate a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n bert-text-classification python=3.8
   conda activate bert-text-classification
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers tqdm pandas
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the IMDB dataset is placed in the project's root directory.
2. Modify the dataset path in the script if necessary.


## Training
- The model is trained using the IMDB dataset with the following parameters:
  - Batch size: 16
  - Learning rate: 2e-5
  - Number of epochs: 3

You can adjust these parameters in the script to suit your needs.

## Evaluation
The script evaluates the model on the validation dataset and prints accuracy metrics. After training, you can use the saved model to make predictions on external text inputs.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any enhancements or bug fixes.
